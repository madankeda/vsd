just do the necessary grammatical corrections in my content:

1. we take application in C file, compile it in GCC and we obtain the output, and lets name it as O0.
2. we model the spec in C Format and test the specification. the outp[ut is obtained and named O1.
3. compare the outputs O0 and O1. iun order to maintain the same required functionality, both the outputs shopuld be equal.
    that is, O0 = 01
4. softcopy of hARDWARE is created using high level languages such as bluespec, chisel.
5. run our application in this rtl model and and obtain the output as O2.
6. O2 should be equal to O1 to have the same functionality
7. then we are splitting the rtl code in to :
a) processor
b) peripherals/IPs

PROCESSOR:
processor code will be synthesizable.

the peripharals/IPs contains:
    a)macros
    b) analog IPs
